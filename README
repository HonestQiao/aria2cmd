==========================================================================
Infomation

License: GPL V3

Requirement
----------
Python version: Not sure. I only tested it with python2.6

Aria2c version: only tested with 1.10.8 and 1.10.9. You'd better use a
relatively new version

For desktop notification, you also need the libnotify-bin package. In 
Debian/Ubuntu:

    $sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin

Usage
----------
1.  Use aria2c.sh script to start aria2c xml-rpc daemon.
   
    The script includes a simple session control and desktop notification

2.  In terminal, run aria2cmd.py to start the main program. Then type help
    for available command.
    
    The above is called interactive mode. You can also run the internal 
    commands in non-interactive mode, for example:

        $./aria2cmd -c "add http://example/test.iso"

Commands
----------
Descript the internal commands.

* add URI         add a URI to download
* rm GID          remove a download
* ls [STATUS]     list all downloads in a status. Valid status are: 
                  active, wait and stop. Default is active
* stop [GID]      stop a download. If no GID is given, stop all
* start [GID]     start a download. If no GID is given, stop all
* clear           clear screen

You can also run arbitrary aria2c xml-rpc command, such as:

    tellStatus("1")

Limitation
----------
1.  Xml-rpc address and port is hard-coded, and xml-rpc username/pass is
    not considered

2.  Session control only contains the URI. It's a temporary work-around,
    since aria2c don't save the download added by addMetalink() and 
    addTorrent() to session at the moment.

3.  Other limitations. I am a begginer...
